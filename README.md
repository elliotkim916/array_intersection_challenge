  Intersection
  Write a function to get the intersection of two arrays
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)
  The function should accept two arrays and return a new array with the elements
  which are common to both arrays.
  Elements should be ordered according to the order in which they occur in the
  first array.
  Example:
  intersection([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]) -> [2, 3]
